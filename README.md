<!-- DAILY QUOTE -->
> The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to become an enemy of all that he reads, and... to question it from every side... His criticism of it must be founded on proofs and demonstrations, not on the likes of the belief of a person in a given statement because of its author's greatness.
