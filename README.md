> Many persons who have for years been familiar with the ordinary routine of a circle of calculation, are yet quite unable to perceive the mutual relations which, in various ways, may be established between the several processes of which that circle may be composed; or to generalise the abstract principle of any one of such processes, and determine its proper place and dependencies amongst others equally general.
