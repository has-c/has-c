<!-- DAILY QUOTE -->
> The duty of the man who studies the books of the scientists, if his aim is the truth, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the text from every angle, to attack it in every way possible. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.
