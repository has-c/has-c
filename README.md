<!-- DAILY QUOTE -->
> A lot of mathematics is about finding the 'right' definitions, the 'right' way to phrase a concept, so that it becomes evident what its properties are and how it relates to other concepts. This is often a geometric rather than an algebraic task, involving a great deal of visualization and intuition.
