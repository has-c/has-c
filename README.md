<!-- DAILY QUOTE -->
> There are two modes of knowledge, namely by argumentation and experience. Argumentation concludes and forces us to concede the conclusion, but it neither makes the conclusion certain, nor does it remove doubt so that the mind may rest in the intuition of truth, unless the mind discovers it by the path of experience.
