<!-- DAILY QUOTE -->
> I have been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine figures, and I have learned how to use them with diligence and care, and how to compose them to get results. Thus I have composed this book, setting forth the entire science of numbers, explaining the method of calculation by these figures, and applying it to various problems.
